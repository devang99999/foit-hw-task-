        <li>To transport personal data
            The commonest use of USB pen drive is to transport or store personal files such as documents, pictures and video. One can also store medical alert information for emergency use or as preparation against disaster.
        </li>
        <li>Successful usage of USB pen drive has been noticed in the PC repair field as a means to transfer recovery and antivirus software to infected PCs. It also allows a portion of the host machine's data to be archived in it in case of emergency.</li>

         <li>You can never be too secure, and turning your USB stick into a key for your computer will ensure that no-one can access your machine unless they have your flash drive. Simply download and install a program (like Predator) and start using your USB drive as a key.
         </li>
         <li>If your PC is running slower than you’d like you can give it a little boost by caching some of your data over to your USB from your PC, so your PC can manage your applications better. This should ensure a quicker experience.

         <li>A computers builtin graphics card shares a part of system memory for their functioning. If a dedicated graphics card is in use, it has its own memory thus freeing up memory from the computer. Additionally these memories are much faster than the system memory.
         </li>
         <li> Besides gaming, a graphics card can definitely enhance your video experience. Especially while watching HD and Blu-ray movies. Moreover video editing too can be done in greater accuracy. It has its own resources to process and compress videos.

        <dd><lh style="font-size: 25px;font-weight: 700;">Uses</lh>
         <li>When it comes to affordability, HDDs are still considered as the most pocket friendly. Hard drives like the SAS-3Gbps HDD are a lot cheaper compared to SSDs of the same capacity. Evidently, the production cost of HDDs is relatively lower, and this cost is calculated per megabyte thus they in terms of prices they tend to cost less.
         </li>
         <li> HDDs are found to have larger storage base capacity options with a standard size of 500 GB in the market which is more than half of the starting capacity of SSDs. Additionally, newer versions of HDDs released also contain larger storage capacity compared to the traditional ones. Expect that you can store a bulk of virtual data in a single drive. You can even easily find external hard drives that contain 6 TB in size.
